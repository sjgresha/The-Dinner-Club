# The-Dinner-Club

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a chatroom that would allow our users to communicate with one another on premade chatrooms. The reason for creating this website was to give our users an outlet to chat about topics they want. The problem our website solves is that it gives people and outlet to vent and discuss certain things with other random users.
## Usage
